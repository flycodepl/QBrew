<h1>Brewing Equipment</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Basic Equipment</h2>

<h3>Fermenters</h3>

<p>A fermenter is the single most important piece of equipment a
brewer owns. Second-hand brewpots and bottle cappers can be used to
make first quality beer, but a scratched, leaky, or flimsy
fermenter will guarantee a spoiled product. So always get the best
quality fermenter you can. I don't recommend plastic fermenters at
all. Not in the least. If you want to know about plastic
fermenters, see the section on <a href="#junk">junk</a>.</p>

<p>Glass carboys, or water bottles, are by far and away the best
fermenters for the homebrewer. Some commercial brewers even use
them! Glass is easy to clean, since you can always see the spots
you missed, and there are no corners to evade a brush. They are
scratch resistant, and don't harbor the odors of long lost
brews.</p>

<p>Carboys come in a variety of sizes. The small two and a half
gallon size is good for half batches, or for meads, where you don't
neccesarily want to make a full five gallons. The standard five
gallon size is great for secondary fermenters, but for primary
fermentations, use a six and a half or seven gallon carboy if you
can. When you put in five gallons of wort into a seven gallon
carboy, you have plenty of headspace. If you use a five gallon
model, you must either use a blow-off tube or reduce your wort to
only four gallons, topping it off with a gallon of water when you
bottle or rack to the secondary.</p>

<p>Another alternative to fermenters is to use five gallon soda
kegs. With a little work, an airlock can fit on the "in" line. Like
a five gallon carboy, make sure you have plenty of headspace. One
advantage to using soda kegs is that you can use CO<sub>2</sub>
pressure to transfer you beer instead of starting a siphon.</p>

<p>I've seen fermenters made out of old copper milks cans and other
dairy equipment. If you have access to them, great.</p>

<h3>Brewpots</h3>

<p>A brewpot can be a five gallon stainless steel pot, an eight
gallon canning pot, or anything else that will hold the wort and
sit on a burner. It is best to boil your full quantity of wort, so
the ideal size of brewpot would be eight to ten gallons, for a five
gallon batch. If you boil in a smaller size, your wort will be
concentrated, resulting in poor hop utilization. Plus, you have to
do a lot of topping off in the fermenter.</p>

<p>Brewpots should be as rugged as you can find them. Lids and
handles are a necessity. If you can find one with a spigot
installed at the bottom, great. Ones with thermometer probes are
even better. Enameled pots should be free of chips. Copper brewpots
are the best if you can afford, or even find, them. Stainless steel
is very durable, can be scrubbed with brute force, and resist
dents. However, stainless steel doesn't conduct heat very well, so
your wort is prone to scorch in spots. By all means, avoid
aluminum, as it reacts with the acidic wort, causing strange and
unpalatable flavors in your finished beer.</p>

<p>They should be able to fit on your stove top, even if they have
to fit over two burners. Gas stoves are preferable to electric. If
you can't use your brewpot on a stove, see the <em><a href=
"#additionals">additional equipment</a></em> section for outdoor
burners.</p>

<p>I have seen plastic brewpots! They have an electric burner built
and insulated from the plastic. By all accounts, they work well,
and are relatively inexpensive. On the down side, boiling wort
produces deposits on the walls of the brewpot, called beer stone,
that takes scrubbing or oven cleaner to remove. Plastic can't hold
up to this kind of cleaning.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Stuff</h3>

<p>Of course, you equipment has to be clean. Old fashioned elbow
grease, sponges and nylon scrub pads will do most of the work for
you. But cleaning in places where your hands won't reach requires
specialized tools. Bottle brushes and carboy brushes are a
necessity. Even if you have a jet-type bottle washer, brushes are
still needed to do the scrubbing. There is even a tiny bottle brush
made for cleaning out airlocks.</p>

<p>Cleaning may get the dirt off, but you need a sanitizer to get
the microbes off. The two most common sanitizers for homebrewing
are chlorine bleach and iodine sanitizer. Campden tablets are also
used, but more suited towards wine and mead making and I would
advise against using them. If you decide to use chlorine bleach, it
<strong>must be unscented</strong>. Iodine sanitizer is sold under
many different brand names. B.T.F. and Iodophor being common
brands.</p>

<p>If you use chlorine bleach, add one to two ounces to five
gallons of cold water. Sanitize your small equipment in this
solution for at least a half of an hour. Then pour your solution
into your carboy to sanitize it. Rinse off the solution from your
equipment with clean, sanitary water.</p>

<p>If you use iodine sanitizer, mix two ounces into five gallons of
water. Let all equipment remain in contact with the solution for at
least five minutes. With this type of sanitizer, you can let your
equipment air-dry without rinsing.</p>

<p>I can not stress enough the importance of sanitizing. Don't kill
yourself over it, but if you neglect it, your beer will let you
know by way of strange odors, foul tastes and exploding
bottles.</p>

<h3>Siphoning Stuff</h3>

<p>Beer is susceptible to oxygen, so pouring fermented beer from
the primary to secondary fermenter, or into bottles is not allowed,
as the splashing will cause oxydation and stale flavors. Siphoning
will need to used instead, unless you have a setup with lots of
spigots.</p>

<p>5/16 inch inside diameter vinyl tubing is the normal siphon
tubing used by homebrewers, although larger diameter tubing allows
for quicker siphoning. Make sure the tubing is food grade. The
tubing you find in the tropical fish section of your local pet
store isn't always food grade. You don't want vinyl flavors in your
finished product. The tubing is next to impossible to clean on the
inside, so keep spares around if you find out a bit of mold took a
liking to the tubing. A piece about three to five feet long should
be plenty.</p>

<p>Siphon tubing doesn't stay straight inside a carboy, so a
racking cane is needed. It looks like a shepards crook, with a
removable tip on the end. The straight end goes all the way down to
the bottom of the transfer vessel, the crooked end connects to the
siphon tubing, and the other end of the tubing goes to the receptor
vessel. Make sure your tubing fits your racking cane.</p>

<p>Racking canes can be acrylic plastic, stainless steel, or
copper. With acrylic, you can see if there are any mold spots on
the inside, but they are fragile, and tend to shatter just when you
get a siphon started. You can't inspect steel or copper canes for
wayward fungi or microbes, but they can be put in dishwashers, or
have boiling water poured through them.</p>

<p>If your brewpot, bottling bucket, and fermentor have spigots at
the bottom, you can avoid siphoning altogether, but make sure your
spigots don't cause a lot of aeration. Ball valves are preferable
to other kinds.</p>

<h3>Bottling Stuff</h3>

<p>Even though you don't want to use a plastic bucket to ferment
in, they are great for bottling buckets. Just be extra careful in
cleaning and sanitizing it. Siphon your finished beer into the
bucket, add your bottling sugar, and gently stir, being careful not
to aerate your beer. Buckets with spigots at the bottom are great
time savers, since you don't have to start a siphon. If you bucket
doesn't have a spigot, you can get them cheaply, and they're easy
to install.</p>

<p>A bottle filler allows you to fill your bottles with a minimum
of fuss. Plastic fillers are the most common, but the brass
varieties will last a lifetime. Avoid fillers with lots of little
parts and springs, as they tend to wear out and stick, and are hard
to clean. Stick them on the end of your siphon hose. When you press
down on the filler, beer flows, when you lift up, the flow stops.
Much easier than using a clamp or valve.</p>

<p>Bottle cappers come in a bewildering variety of shapes, sizes
and forms. Wing cappers are hand held: simply place on top of
bottle and press down on the levers. These are the cheapest, most
common, and they don't take up a lot of room. Bench cappers take up
a lot more room, but are easier to use, especially if you are
capping a lot of bottles, all the same size. Just put a bottle on
the stand, pull down lever, done. If you use bottles of different
sizes, you have to keep readjusting the bench capper height. If you
perchance find a hammer operated capper at a flea mart, leave it
there!</p>

<p>Your bottles should be brown glass, and non-threaded. Avoid
clear or green bottles, as they will promote <a href=
"primer-glossary.html#lightstruck">light-struck</a> beer. Bottles
with Grolsch type swing tops work well, just make sure the rubber
gaskets are good. The easiest way to get your bottles is to buy
them with the beer already in them! Drink them up, clean off the
lables with plenty of elbow-grease, and use. Most homebrew supply
stores will carry cases of empty, new 12 and 22 oz. bottles.</p>

<p>There are two basic variety of bottle caps, the first being the
plain cap, the second being the oxygen-absorbing cap. This type of
cap is good for barleywines and other beer needing a lot of aging,
since these caps will absorb any oxygen out of the headspace. Since
they are activated by water, place what you need in a cup of
sanitized water right when you are ready to bottle. Don't use the
very inexpensive caps you can find at the soda distributors. They
are not as strong a cap, and we used them on one batch, only to
have them bulge and break the seal.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Stuff</h3>

<p>You will need an airlock of some kind, with a stopper to fit
your fermenter. Airlocks come in two basic varieties, the three
piece and the "S" type. The three piece is much easier to clean,
but they both do their job well. If you can find the pyrex lab
quality ones, go for it.</p>

<p>A good thermometer is essential. It should have a range from 70
to 212 degrees, and be suitable for sticking in boiling liquids.
Most candy thermometers will work, but their range tends to be too
high.</p>

<p>Other equipment you will need are muslin or nylon bags to hold
crushed grains or hops, a long handled brewing spoon (not wood), an
postage style scale to measure hops, and various kitchen utensils
such as funnels, strainers, teaspoons, etc.</p>

<hr>
<a name="additionals"></a> 

<h2>Additional Equipment</h2>

<h3>Grain Mills</h3>

<p>In order to get the most out of your grains, they must be
properly crushed. A grain mill makes this much, much easier than
the rolling pin method, especially if you're crushing twelve pounds
of grain for a mash. Many homebrew shops will crush the grain for
you, but for maximum freshness, they should be crushed the day of
brewing.</p>

<p>Corona type mills are the least expensive and most common. They
have a tendency to grind more than crush. This is okay for
steeping, but for mashing, a proper crush is tantamount to a good
yield.</p>

<p>Roller type mills crush malt the best. They may be made with
single or double rollers, and some can be adjusted while cranking,
and others not. The ease of cranking can be a major factor in
selecting a mill, especially if you're crushing a lot of grain. If
you can, try out a mill before you buy. You should expect to pay
about 80 to 120 dollars for a good grain mill.</p>

<h3>Wort Chillers</h3>

<p>A good wort chiller can be one of the best investments made in
homebrewing. It is essential that your finished wort be cooled to
pitching temperatures as quickly as possible. Setting your brewpot
out in the snow bank takes too much time. Besides the risk of
infection, long cooling times can cause greater amounts of DMS to
form (which causes vegetable like flavors).</p>

<p>Immersion wort chillers are simply coils of copper or steel
tubing that is set inside the brewpot. Water running through the
chiller cools off the wort. They are very easy to sanitize, just
put the cleaned coil in the brewpot ten minutes before the end of
the boil, and the heat sterilizes it. Most immersion chillers have
fitting to fit a garden hose, so if you brew inside, you will need
a kitchen faucet adaptor, or have to snake your hose in through the
kitchen window. Chillers tend to come in 25 or 50 foot lengths, for
five and ten gallon batches, respectively.</p>

<p>Counterflow wort chillers operate by flowing the hot wort
through a tubing that is surrounded by a larger tubing with cold
water running in the opposite direction (hence the name). These
chillers can cool wort as fast as it can flow from one end to the
other. Usually, the wort is siphoned from the brewpot, through the
chiller, and directly into the fermenter. Some even have valves to
inject oxygen for aeration enroute. Counterflow chillers are more
expensive then immersion chillers, but you can buy the fitting
seperately and make your own with a length of garden hose and
copper tubing. One drawback to counterflow chillers is that they
are difficult to clean and sanitize, and some brewers resort to
running boiling water through them.</p>

<h3>Hydrometers</h3>

<p>Just about every book on basic homebrewing lists hydrometers as
mandatory equipment. They are <strong>not</strong> mandatory, but
they are usefull in two areas: knowing your beer's strength so you
can place it in the proper judging category, and for batch logging
to record what you've done so you can repeat it again.</p>

<p>Hydrometers look like thermometers, but they measure <a href=
"primer-glossary.html#sg">specific gravity</a>, or how much your
beer weighs, instead. Water has a specific gravity of 1.000, with
wort having gravities of 1.020 to 1.150 or higher. As a point of
comparison, wort for a pale ale tends to fall between 1.035 to
1.050 gravities. Hydrometers are calibrated to read at a
temperature of 60 degrees fahrenheit.</p>

<h3>Outdoor Cookers</h3>

<p>Some people, especially spouses, parents, children and
roommates, object to the smell of brewing beer. I am baffled as to
why. It's no worse than the smell of canning vegetables. But if you
and your hobby have been banished from the house, then you need an
outdoor cooker. These cookers operate on propane, and put out
enough heat to bring your brewpot to a rolling boil. They are
sometimes known as Cajun cookers.</p>

<p>Your cooker should have a minimum of a 30,000 BTU heat output.
The higher outputs will bring your wort to a boil quicker, but the
lower rated ones are great for the fine control needed for mashing.
Try to get one with a ring shaped burner. The single-jet burner
types tend to scorch as a lot of heat is applied to one small spot
on the kettle. If you can't get five gallons of wort to boil with
one of these, you may be using a gas-grill type regulator. Switch
it out to regulator that came with the cooker and you'll be
fine.</p>

<h3>Yeast Culturing Stuff</h3>

<p>Culturing your own yeast is a great way to get just the right
yeast for your beer. Yeast can be bought in slants, or cultured
from the bottles of bottle-conditioned commercial beer. There's a
lot of stuff you can use to culture your own yeast, so only the
basics will be listed here.</p>

<p>Canning jars and lids are great for making up enough starters to
last all year. Just make up a batch of starter twelves times a big
as normal, and can it in twelve jars just like you're canning
jelly. If you don't can your starters, you'll need a small pot or
erlenmeyer flask to boil up your individual starters. If you prefer
to use airlocks with your starters, make up a lid with a hole in it
the right size to hold an airlock and stopper. <em>Make sure
everything is sanitized!</em> If you are only going to use
smack-packs and vials, this is all you need.</p>

<p>If you will be growing yeast from slants or bottles, a nichrome
culturing loop, alcohol lamp and a test tube are essential. Yeast
nutrient is can be added to plain wort to grow the yeast in, or you
can buy wort specially made for growing yeast. Petri dishes, extra
test tubes or blank slants, and agar medium are necessary if you'll
be keeping yeast cultures for extended periods of time, or if you
want to purify your culture.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Mashing Gear</h2>

<h3>Mash Tuns</h3>

<p>For the most part, your brewpot can double as your mash tun. It
holds your grains and liquor (water) at the precise temperature
needed to convert starch into sugar, and to break down proteins. If
you want a separate mash tun, a five gallon stainless steel pot
with a lid works great, but you might need something larger if you
are mashing high gravity brews. Picnic and water coolers also work
great. You can also get a combined mash-lauter tun. This is
discussed below.</p>

<p>A mash tun should retain its temperature well. Wrap flexible
insulation around the tun, or rest the tun in a preformed box of
styrofoam. You can also set the tun on the stove, monitor the
temperature, and give it short bursts of heat to maintain the
temperature.</p>

<h3>Lauter Tuns</h3>

<p>A lauter tun is used to hold the mashed grains while the wort is
<a href="primer-glossary.html#sparge">sparged</a>. Like a mash tun,
it should be insulated. A false bottom or manifold in the lauter
tun hold the grain back while the sweet wort is drawn off from the
bottom. There are many different varieties of lauter tuns. Picnic
cooler style tuns have a manifold of slotted copper pipe in the
bottom. Gott cooler types have plastic false bottoms that are
perferated with myriad tiny holes. Lauter tuns made from kegs or
large kettles also have false bottoms, but they are made of
stainless steel or copper. Some have circular slotted copper
manifolds. Thousands of years ago, lauter tuns were wooden troughs
with a bed of clean straw or twigs to act as a false bottom.</p>

<p>Many homebrewers prefer to combine their mash and lauter tuns
into one unit. This is simply done by just using the lauter tun to
mash in. If you do this, make sure your tun is very well insulated,
or made of metal so you can apply direct heat to it. The reason why
very few commercial brewers combine their tuns is because while
they use the lauter tun for one batch, they can be cleaning the
mash tun, and mashing in it while the sparge is still taking place.
Commercial brewers have their time and labor scheduled for the
utmost efficiency, while we homebrewers can do what we want.</p>

<h3>Sparging Stuff</h3>

<p>A sparger is a unit that gently and gradually adds hot water to
the lauter tun. Most spray the water on top of the grain bed, while
others drip the water, and still others gently pour the water in
through a tiny tube. The sparger should let the water flow slowly
enough to let the entire process last for forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>A hot liquor tank holds the hot water needed for sparging. A
simple bottling bucket will do for five gallon batches, but you'll
need to insulate it, and install a spigot if it doesn't have one
already. Some brewers use their mash tun as a hot liquor tank.
Don't use your brewpot, because that's what you'll be sparging
into.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll need tubing to go from the the hot liquor tank
to the sparger, and from the lauter tun to the bottom of the
brewpot. Don't let the wort splash into the brewpot or you'll get
hot-side aeration, which is not a good thing.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Kegging Gear</h2>

<h3>Kegs</h3>

<p>Commercial style beer kegs are too hard to use for homebrewers.
If someone gives you a beer keg because they've heard you make your
own beer, thank them profusely, and use it to make a mash tun
instead.</p>

<p>What homebrewer's use to keg their beer are soda kegs. They come
in a variety of sizes, but the five gallon is the most common. Used
soda kegs are becoming more common as time goes by since many soda
distributors are switching to syrup-in-a-box systems. Used kegs run
about forty dollars, but check around. I've seen them as low as
twenty dollars. Sometimes you can get them for free if you know
where and when to look.</p>

<p>When you get your keg, make sure it is free of any soda smells.
You do not want your porter tasting like Cherry Coke! Replace all
the o-rings and poppet valves if they haven't been already. Its a
good idea to replace them once a year anyway. TSP (trisodium
phosphate) is the best cleaner to use on kegs, but wear gloves. Do
not use bleach sanitizers with stainless steel kegs. Use iodine
solutions instead, or (carefully) pour five gallons of boiling
water in them to sanitize.</p>

<p>Kegs will have either pin-lock or ball-lock fittings. Either one
is fine, but if you get more than one keg, make sure they're all
the same.</p>

<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> Tanks</h3>

<p>To dispense your beer from kegs, you will need to use a
CO<sub>2</sub> tank. These can be pricy to own, which is why the
small five pound model is popular. However, the five pound model is
also the most difficult to find. CO<sub>2</sub> tanks have to be
recertified every so often in most places.</p>

<p>Along with your tank, you need to get a CO<sub>2</sub> pressure
regulator. Most regulators have a range from zero to 100 PSI, which
is much more than you need. The best kind to get have a pressure
range of zero to fifty PSI. A "gauge cage" is a steel cage that
clamps around your regulator to protect it if your tank falls
over.</p>

<h3>Fittings, Hoses and Spigots</h3>

<p>To run the CO<sub>2</sub> from the tank to the keg, you need a
gas connector. To run the beer from the keg to your glass, you need
a tap. Both of these will have fittings for the keg. The fitting
for the inlet will not fit on the outlet, and vice versa. There is
a huge variety of fittings, hoses, rings, manifolds, etc. available
for kegging. Instead of trying to decide what you need, just get a
kegging kit.</p>

<h3>Counterpressure Bottle Fillers</h3>

<p>Kegging is convenient and easy, but sometimes you need beer in a
bottle, for a competition for instance, or for delivery to a
friend. In these cases, a counterpressure bottle filler lets you
bottle beer from the keg.</p>

<p>There are many different C.P. bottle fillers out there, but they
all work on the same principle. Fit the filler into the bottle,
equalize the pressure, ease off the pressure to let the beer flow
into the bottle, stop the flow, cap. You must practice, practice,
practice this sequence on plain water before you try it out for the
first time on your favorite batch. Once you get the rythm down, its
easy.</p>

<h3>Keg Alternatives</h3>

<p>Kegging and kegging equipment can be expensive. Even if money is
no object, sometimes you want your beer in the fridge, and your keg
won't fit. The most popular keg alternative is the mini-keg. These
are five-liter systems that originated in Germany. These tiny kegs
are reusable, and their beer is dispensed with either
CO<sub>2</sub> cartridges, or a hand operated pump. A mini-keg will
last about ten uses, if you care for them properly.</p>

<p>The Party Pig&reg; is also a favorite. It is a two gallon
acrylic plastic jug with a tap, that will fit into a fridge.
Instead of using CO<sub>2</sub> or a hand pump to dispense the
beer, a special pack is used. This is fitted into the pig before
racking the beer inside. When activated, the pack swells,
pressurizing the beer.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Time Saving Widgets</h2>

<p>These items are in no way necessary to brew beer, but they have
been invented to save the time of the brewer, who usually has
little to spare. These are great to add to your christmas or
birthday lists.</p>

<h3>Bottle Trees and Carboy Stands</h3>

<p>When a bottle or carboy has been sanitized, it needs to drain
before use. Setting them upside down in your dishwasher is the
usual method, but sometimes the dishwasher is in use, or you don't
trust its sanitation.</p>

<p>Bottle trees are poles with little prongs sticking out to hold
bottles upside down to drain. They screw apart so that the pieces
of the tree can be sanitized. And since all your fifty-plus bottles
are in one spot, bottling go by that much quicker. An alternative
to the bottle tree is the bottle rack, which is a board with holes
in it to hold the bottles by the neck.</p>

<p>A carboy stand holds your carboy upside-down while drying. For
ten to twenty dollars, they tend to be pricey for what you do with
them, but it's better than holding them upside-down in your hands
for fifteen minutes! Plus, it's easy to make one yourself.</p>

<h3>Carboy Handles and Straps</h3>

<p>Full carboys are very heavy objects. And if you've managed to
spill some wort on the outside of them, they're slippery too.
Carboy handles and straps help you to manage the load safely.
Handles fit around the neck of the carboy, but I don't trust them
to hold the entire weight of the carboy, and recommend them only to
steady and balance the thing. They are several kinds of straps, but
the nicest one I've seen is actually a nylon carboy bag with
strap-handles, that does double duty as a carboy insulator.</p>

<h3>Siphon Starters</h3>

<p>Since the days of Archimedes, the intrepid inventer has been
searching for new and different ways to start a siphon. The
popularity of homebrewing has only hastened that search, and a
menagerie of siphon starters in all sizes and shapes can be had.
Some are more complicated than they are worth. Others work only
some of the time. But some are simply fantastic time-savers. My
advice is to ask your homebrew supplier on his or her opinion. If
you can, try them out before you by.</p>

<h3>Bottle Washers</h3>

<p>After you've cleaned out your bottles with soap and water, do
rinse the soap out, rinse again, then again, and yet again? You
definately do not want sopay tasting beer. A way to speed this
process up twenty fold is to get a bottle washer. These items fit
onto your kitchen faucet. When you push a bottle onto them, a spray
of high pressure water quickly rinses them out. They're also great
for dislodging the stubborn yeast that has dried on the bottom of
your used homebrew bottles. Some models come with a double jet
system, that makes your work go by twice as fast. If you bottle
your beer, they are certainly worth looking into.</p>

<hr>
<a name="junk"></a> 

<h2>Junk to Avoid</h2>

<p>Not everything that you find in a homebrew supply store is worth
your money.</p>

<h3>Plastic Fermenters</h3>

<p>While I won't argue to merits of closed versus open
fermentation, it is agreed by all that plastic fermenters are
unsuitable for either. They may work for one batch, but sooner or
later you will have to scrub them with a gallon of elbow grease,
and then you'll have scratches. Scratches are the perfect place for
bacteria to hide in to avoid your sanitizing solution. Glass
carboys, though more expensive, will last a lifetime, and are a
cinch to clean.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most prepackaged homebrewing kits include a
plastic bucket fermenter, to save money. In my opinion, when they
cheapen the kit, they cheapen the hobby! Use the fermenter as a
storage container for all your stuff, and buy a carboy instead.</p>

<h3>That Winemaking Stuff Next to the Brewing Stuff</h3>

<p>There is a lot of equipment meant for making wine that's jumbled
up on the shelves with the beer making stuff. Sometimes they are
even labeled as suitable for homebrewing. Don't be fooled.
Titration test kits are useless in brewing beer. Corking systems
are great for bottling magnums, but unless your hobby spills over
into meads, don't even bother with corks or anything associated
with them. Most wine sanitizers are meant to work with the acidity
of wine, and do a poor job with beer. And all those vials and
packets of strange chemicals...ignore them.</p>

<p>Okay, there's one exception: if you want to use
<strong>real</strong> wooden kegs, wine making supplies are often
the only source for the stuff you need to care for them. But know
what you're doing first. Wooden kegs are not for the faint of
heart. In the days before stainless steel, there were people who
did nothing else but clean and care for wooden kegs.</p>

<hr>
<h2>All the Rest</h2>

<h3>Refrigerators</h3>

<p>If you keg your beer, or want to make a lager, a refrigerator is
almost a necessity. And even if you don't keg or lager, an extra
one is nice to store your aging beer or yeast cultures. Used
refrigerators tend to run about $100 in this part of the world.
Shop around and you might find one for about fifty. But check them
out. They're being sold for some reason, make sure it's not because
they won't keep cold!</p>

<p>If you do get a brewing fridge, a brewing thermostat is
definately the next item to get. They will keep your refrigerator
at the exact temperature you need, and they'll save you energy
too.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>

<p>For those who want to make crystal clear beer just like the big
boys do, a beer filter will take you there. Homebrew filters are
placed between two kegs. CO<sub>2</sub> pressure is used to
transfer beer from one keg, through the filter, and into the other
keg.</p>

<p>Use finings before you filter. Don't throw your money away by
clogging your filters with yeasts and proteins that could have been
removed with a teaspoon of isinglass. Think of filters as the final
step in perfecting your beer, not as whitewash to hide your
mistakes. Crystal clear beer is very recent development in the
history of beer, and many beer styles allow a certain amount of
haze and cloudiness in the glass to account for it.</p>
