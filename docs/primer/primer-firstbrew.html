<h1>Your First Homebrew</h1>

<hr>
<p>Making your own beer is easy. People have been brewing at home
for several thousand years, and they did it with much less
education and resources than you now possess.</p>

<p>The beer we are going to make is known as an extract beer. It is
slightly more complex than <a href=
"primer-glossary.html#beerkit">beer kits</a>, where you just add
water, but it will have a much more refined taste. Plus, it's much
easier than <a href="primer-glossary.html#mashing">mashing</a> your
beer the old-fashioned way, and with the quality of ingredients now
available, it's hard to tell the difference.</p>

<p>You may discover simpler how-to guides than this, and that's
fine. I've decided to err on the side of quality rather than
simplicity.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Necessary Equipment</h2>

<p>Beginning homebrew kits can be bought from homebrew supply shops
for about $40 to $60, but they rarely include all the essential
equipment. They are still a good deal, however, because they're
cheaper as a package, rather than buying everthing seperate. If
your kit doesn't contain all of the items listed below, make sure
you pick them up as well. Some items can be found in your kitchen,
and others you can borrow from a fellow brewer.</p>

<ul type="DISK">
<li>Carboy, five or six and 1/2 gallon, preferably glass</li>

<li>Brewpot, five to ten gallon, the bigger the better, with a
lid</li>

<li>Brushes, both carboy and bottle varieties</li>

<li>Airlock and stopper, three piece locks are easier to clean</li>

<li>Racking cane, with tip</li>

<li>Siphon tubing, to fit the racking cane</li>

<li>Bottling bucket, five or seven gallon plastic bucket</li>

<li>Bottle capper</li>

<li>Bottle filler</li>

<li>Bottles and caps, 54 twelve ounce brown glass bottles with
crown caps</li>

<li>Cheesecloth bag, to hold one pound of grain</li>

<li>Brewing spoon, long enough to stir the brewpot with</li>

<li>Thermometer, candy-type, with a range from 100 to 200
degrees</li>

<li>Miscellaneous kitchen utensils, funnels, strainers, teaspoons,
etc.</li>

<li>Sanitizer, chlorine or iodine based</li>

<li>Blow-Off tube, used if you only have a five gallon carboy.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>The Recipe</h2>

<p>This is a basic recipe for an American style ale. I've left some
decisions up to you, so it might end up as a pale ale, and amber
ale, or something else. If your beginner's brewing kit includes
ingredients (as many do), by all means use it! Just check to see
that all the ingredients listed below are included in some
variation or another. Above all, get the freshest fixings
available.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Malt Extract</dt>

<dd>Six pounds of either light or amber <em>unhopped</em> malt
extract syrup. If all you can use is <em>hopped</em> extract,
because that's what came with your brewing kit, just make sure you
use an <a href="primer-glossary.html#aromahops">aroma hop</a> in
this recipe. Your homebrew supplier can help you.</dd>

<dt>Specialty Grains</dt>

<dd>One pound of crystal malt grains. Crystal malts are rated by
color, so get a light (10L) to medium (55L) color malt. You can get
them crushed or uncrushed, but uncrushed grains stays fresher
longer, something to think about if you're ordering through the
mail.</dd>

<dt>Hops</dt>

<dd>Two ounces of a pacific northwest hop, such as Centennial,
Columbus or Galena. They may be in either pellet, plug or whole
leaf form. Pellets are easier to use, as there are no hop petals to
interfer with your siphon, and they tend to keep better. On the
other hand, you can't beat fresh whole hops for flavor.</dd>

<dt>Yeast</dt>

<dd>One <a href="primer-glossary.html#smackpack">smack pack</a> of
British or American style ale yeast. There are a gadzillion
varieties of yeasts out there, but as long as it's not a lager,
wheat or exotic yeast, it will work fine.</dd>

<dt>Bottling Sugar</dt>

<dd>Three-fourths cup of brewer's bottling sugar (corn sugar). Do
<strong>not</strong> mistake this for Karo syrup! If you must, you
can substitute an equal amount of brown sugar.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>
<h2>Brewing</h2>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<p>Three to four days before the big brew day, you need to "smack"
your yeast. Read the directions on the smack pack for how to do
this. Make sure you shaike it vigorously for several minutes
afterwards. Put the smack pack in a cool place, like your pantry,
until brew day. By then, the pack will have swollen to about two
inches thick. If it hasn't, it probably wasn't fresh enough, so
postpone brew day an extra couple of days to give it more time.</p>

<p>On brew day, organize your brewing area. Make sure your
equipment is clean. <a href="#sanitation">Sanitize</a> your carboy,
racking cane, airlock, stopper and siphon tubing. Re-read these
directions so that you'll know what to do next at any given
time.</p>

<h3>Steeping</h3>

<p>If you haven't bought your specialty grains pre-crushed, you'll
need to crush them now. Place them on a cutting board, and use a
rolling pin to crush them to grit sized pieces. They should
<strong>not</strong> be ground or chopped. Put the crushed grains
into your cheesecloth bag.</p>

<p>Set the brewpot on the stove and add four to five gallons of
non-chlorinated water, but not so much that it would be apt to boil
over. Turn up the heat and put in the bag of grains. Monitor the
temperature and move the bag often to prevent scorching. When the
temperature is 170 degrees, turn off the heat, cover the pot, and
let it sit for ten to twenty minutes. (now is a good time to put
your malt syrup in a sink of hot water so it will flow easily
during the next step). Pick up the bag, let it drain, then pour two
or three cups of hot water over it slowly to rise out all the good
stuff.</p>

<h3>Boiling</h3>

<p>Bring the brewpot up to a boil and stir in your malt extract. Be
sure to stir the bottom of the pot so the extract won't burn. This
addition of extract will lower the temperature, so bring it back up
to a full rolling boil. Note the time and add one ounce of hops.
Keep a close eye on the mixture, because as every experienced
brewer can tell you, <cite>"an unwatched pot always boils
over!"</cite></p>

<p>Forty minutes later, add one-half ounce of hops. Fifteen minutes
later add the remaining half ounce of hops.</p>

<p>One hour after you have started the boil (five minutes after the
last hops were added), turn off the heat and cover the pot. This is
now a critical time for beer. From now on, let nothing that has not
been <a href="#sanitation">sanitized</a> come in contact with the
beer until you drink it.</p>

<h3>Chilling</h3>

<p>The 212 degree unfermented beer, called <dfn><a href=
"primerglossary.html#wort">wort</a></dfn>, needs to be cooled down
to about 70 degrees as <strong>fast</strong> as possible.
Eventually you will purchase a wort-chiller and wonder how you ever
lived without one. Until then, here's what to do.</p>

<p>Stick your pot in the sink, or if it doesn't fit, into your
bathtub. Fill the sink with water halfway up the pot (more thatn
this and you risk the pot tilting over). Open the drain slightly
and allow water to run into the sink so that there's a slight flow
of cold water running around the brewpot. Add plenty of ice around
the pot. When it all melts away, add another quantity of ice. When
it melts, the pot <em>should</em> be cool enough. Feel the sides of
the pot to make sure. If the temperature only down down to 80
degrees or so, that's fine.</p>

<h3>Racking</h3>

<p>The process of <a href="#siphoning">siphoning</a> beer from one
container to another is called racking. You now need to rack your
beer from the brewpot into a <a href="#sanitation">sanitized</a>
carboy.</p>

<p>Set the brewpot on a counter with the carboy on the floor below
it. Assemble the sanitized racking cane and siphon hose, and fill
with clean, sanitary water. Pinch off the end of the hose, stick
the end of the racking can into the brewpot all the way to the
bottom, and begin siphoning. Don't worry about the dregs left
behind in the brewpot when you're done.</p>

<p>If you don't feel like siphoning yet, use a large funnel, and
pour the wort into the carboy, but be carefull, it's heavy. It's
also a good idea when pouring to use a strainer to strain out whole
hops if you used them.</p>

<p>You probably won't have a full five gallons of wort, since a lot
of the water evaporated in the boil. Use clean, sanitary water to
fill the carboy to the five gallon level.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Fermentation</h2>

<p>"Pitch" the Yeast into the carboy by cutting off a corner of the
smack pack with scissors and pouring the lot into the wort. If you
used dry yeast, it will have to be <a href=
"primer-glossary.html#hydrate">hydrated</a> first.</p>

<p>Cover the carboy with a piece of sanitized foil and rock it back
and forth, splashing the wort around. This is called aerating the
wort. Do your rocking on a piece of carpet or cardboard so that the
carboy won't chip or break. Keep it up for five minutes at least.
It's good exercise.</p>

<p>If you use a five gallon carboy, you will need to use a <a href=
"primer-glossary.html#blowoff">blow-off tube</a>. If you use a six
and a half gallon carboy, assemble your airlock and stopper and fit
into the carboy. Make sure that you still have plenty of space
between the top of the wort and the neck of the carboy. Fermenting
beer will develop a lot of foam, and it's not a pretty site to wake
up in the morning to find a third of your beer on the floor. Put
your beer in a cool, dark corner or cellar, cover with a towel to
keep stray <a href="primer-glossary.html#lightstruck">light</a>
out, and wait one week. You can watch the airlock while you
wait.</p>

<p>If after a week, you still get bubbles through the airlock more
often than once every thirty seconds, wait some more until it has
slowed down.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Bottling</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to have someone help you bottle. There are a
lot of steps in bottling, so it might help to practice first.
Develop a good rhythm. A good division of labor is for the brewer
to fill the bottles and the helper to cap them.</p>

<p>Clean and sanitize your bottles, caps, siphoning apparatus,
bottle filler and bottling bucket. Boil a sauce pan of water with
the 3/4 cup of bottling sugar. The sugar solution will give the
yeast in the bottles just enough stuff to ferment as to cause
carbonation. Cover and let it cool. Put the sugar solution in the
bucket and siphon the beer from the carboy into the bucket. Try not
to agitate or spash the beer. Gently stir the beer a couple of
times to make sure the sugar is well distributed.</p>

<p>Assemble your racking cane and siphon tubing, this time adding
the bottle filler to the end of the tubing. The bottle filler will
let the beer flow when you gently push down on the tip, and stop
the flow when you lift up.</p>

<p>Siphon the beer from the bottling bucket into an empty bottle,
cap the bottle, get another empty bottle, repeat.</p>

<p>Put the bottles in a cool dark place, not your fridge, because
the yeast still have a little work left to do. The beer will be
ready to drink in two weeks (one week if you're desperate). Uncap,
pour into your favorite beer glass, leaving the thin layer of yeast
behind. Enjoy! It's the best beer you've ever had!</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<a name="sanitation"></a> 

<h3>Sanitation</h3>

<p>Sanitation does not mean sterilization. Sterilizing your
equipment is simply not practical for a home brewer. Sanitizing
will get rid of almost all the beer-spoiling microbes on your
equipment. Your goal is to make sure your friendly yeast get to
your beer before other microscopic beasties can.</p>

<p>Nothing can be sanitized if it is not cleaned first. Bits of
grease, grime and scum are perfect places for bacteria to hide from
your sanitizer. Clean your countertops. Clean your hands too! Keep
flies away from everything.</p>

<p>The three most common sanitizers for homebrewing are campden
tablets, chlorine bleach, and iodine sanitizer. Campden tablets are
more suited towards wine and mead making and I would advise against
using them. If you decide to use chlorine bleach, it <strong>must
be unscented</strong>. Iodine sanitizer is sold under many
different brand names. B.T.F. and Iodophor being common brands.</p>

<p>If you use chlorine bleach, add one to two ounces to five
gallons of cold water. Sanitize your small equipment in this
solution for at least a half of an hour. Then pour your solution
into your carboy to sanitize it. Rinse off the solution from your
equipment with clean, sanitary water.</p>

<p>If you use iodine sanitizer, mix two ounces into five gallons of
water. Let all equipment remain in contact with the solution for at
least five minutes. With this type of sanitizer, you can let your
equipment air-dry without rinsing.</p>

<a name="siphoning"></a> 

<h3>Siphoning</h3>

<p>Starting a siphon is easy, just suck on the end of the tube. But
don't do it! You get all of the bacteria in your mouth on the
siphon tube where they will find their way into your beer. Starting
a sanitary siphon is not much more difficult, however. There are a
few siphon-starting gadgets on the market, but they have their
drawbacks.</p>

<p>The most basic way to start a siphon is to fill the racking cane
and tubing with clean, sanitary water. If you have a bacterial
filter on your kitchen faucet, just hold the end of the tube under
a stream of water. Otherwise, use one of those tiny funnels that
will fit into the tubing, and slowly pour in some bottled water.
When the water reaches the end of the racking cane, pinch off the
end of the siphon tube. Make sure that there aren't any air bubbles
in the line. Put the tip on the racking cane.</p>

<p>Make sure that the bottom of the container you are siphoning
from is higher than the top of the container you are siphoning to.
Put the end of the racking tube in the first container all the way
to the bottom. Put the end of the siphon tubing into the other
container, and voila! A siphon.</p>

<p>It is a very good idea to practice this technique with buckets
of plain water before you attempt it for the first time on your
precious beer.</p>
