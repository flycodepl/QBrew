<h1>The Design Primer</h1>

<p>The design of beer, like much of human creativity, is a mix of
science and art. An architect must know the science of structure,
as well as the art of form. One without the other leads to
uselessness or ugliness. For this reason, the Design Primer is
divided into two sections: the science of beer design, and the art
of beer design.</p>

<a name="top"></a>

<table cellpadding="5">

<th width="50%">The Science of Beer Design</th>

<tr>
<td valign="TOP"><!-- Start of Science (column one) -->
<p>The scientific approach to beer design starts with an analysis.
Once a beer style has been chosen, examine and analyze its numbers:
International Bittering Units, Original Gravity, Terminal Gravity,
Color. Read the style description to determine what attributes are
mandatory, acceptable or forbidden.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>We will choose an Irish dry stout as an example for beer design.
The numbers tell us that dry stouts have an OG of 1038 to 1048,
bitterness of 30 to 40 IBU's, and a color of over 40 SRM. The style
description tells us that dry-roastiness and head character are
mandatory, a woody-earthy flavor is acceptable, along with some
lactic sourness, and strong hop flavors and aroma are
forbidden.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Next, we build up our recipe by ingredients, making sure the
numbers true to form. Malts are the best place to start, followed
by hops, yeast and water.</p>

<p>Use pale malts to build up the gravity. An exception to this is
where styles demand base malts other than pale, such as viennas and
bocks. In all cases, start with the lightest malt acceptable for
the style. Extract brewers should start with pale malt extracts.
Adjust the amount of these malts to bring the predicted original
gravity to the lower or middle of the acceptable range.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>Six pounds of pale malt extract, or seven and a half pounds of
pale ale malt grains will produce an original gravity of about
1.042.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Build up the color and character of the recipe with specialty
grains. In this there is no substitute for knowing your
ingredients. A half pound of chocolate malt will add the same
amount of color as four pounds of 50L crystal malt, but the
resulting characters will be vastly different. As a rule of thumb,
use the middle color range of malts (chocolate malt instead of
crystal or black malt). Again, check your style descriptions. Check
the resulting color against the style. Also recheck the original
gravity calculations.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>The style calls for roasted barley. Since this is a very dark
grain, we won't use any other specialty grain for color. However,
the medium body and caramel flavor for dry stouts means we'll have
to use crystal malts to build up the wort. A pound of light (20L)
crystal, and a pound and a half of roasted barley will give us a
color of 52 SRM (160 home color units). The added grains will bring
the original gravity up to 1.052. We might want to lower the base
malts down a bit to adjust this number.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now we need to work on the hops. Always choose a hop variety to
reflect the style origin. Use British hops for British styles,
German hops for German styles, and so on. When a style calls for
hop bitterness, flavor and aroma to be balanced, add the hops at
different times during the boil, rather than all at once. Compute
the hop bitterness for each hop addition and adjust until the
numbers are right.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>For a dry stout, hop flavor and aroma is negligible, so we'll
ignore it, and stick with a higher alpha hop, since a lesser amount
will be needed, and the flavor and aroma will be driven off in the
boil. We'll choose Northern Brewer, since it has a British origin,
but has a much higher alpha acid content than the traditional East
Kent Goldings. This particular example package of hops has an alpha
acid percentage of 8%. Using our calculator, we find that one and a
half ounces of hops added to the start of the boil will yield us 36
IBU's. Just right.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can be a bit more subjective in the selection of yeasts. A
yeast with a neutral character is always safe. If there is a yeast
traditionally used for your intended style, then use it. For some
styles this is mandatory. For other styles, different yeasts can
fill out the character of the finished beer. Read the yeast
descriptions if you can find them. As with hops, matching the
origin of the yeast to the style is a good idea.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>We note that several yeast brands carry an "Irish Ale" or an
"Irish Dry Stout" yeast. We will use these. If they weren't
available, we would consider another British yeast, preferably one
that imparts an earthy character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Finally we come to the water. The true scientific brewer would
use various salts and additives to make the brewing water match the
style's water of origin. For many brewers, this is not practical or
desirable. Water chemistry can be safely ignored, unless the style
says otherwise. An exception to this would be if your brewing water
was excessively hard or soft to begin with, or had unusual amounts
ions in it. In these cases, correct the water to normal levels.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>For a dry stout, there is no particular style guideline for
water. If we wished to make our water match that of Dublin's, we
certainly could. Of course, we should make sure our water is not
extremely hard or soft.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Some styles call for ingredients other than malt, hops, yeast or
water. There are simply too many adjuncts to include in this
primer. Instead, find out what other brewers are using, and how.
Read the winning recipes in "Zymurgy". Examine the recipes in <a
href="primer-recipes.html">Recipe Lists</a>. Try to find at least
three good recipes that use your desired ingredient, and compare
them.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>A lactic sourness is mentioned in the description of dry stouts.
Many brewers use a bit of lactic acid to achieve this. Others sour
a portion of their beer. However, since this is a not a requirement
of the style, we will not attempt to add that character to our
beer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>One must also consider brewing technique. Many lager styles
demand double or triple decoctions. Simulating a lambic would
require a demanding fermentation schedule. If your beer style
requires a brewing technique out of the ordinary, it would behoove
you to use it. Sometimes the ingredients will demand special
procedures. Very pale malt often requires a protein rest during the
mash.</p>

<p>Finally, we are at the end of the scientific design method. We
have skipped some topics of this approach, but they are useless to
us until we have learned about the art of designing beer.</p>

<div>
<p><a href="#top">Back to the Top</a></p>
</div>
</td>
<td valign="TOP"><!-- Start of Art (column two) -->
<p>As the old saying goes, "If you want to play the blues, you have
to pay your dues". This is applicable to every art form. If you
paint, you must know your pigments. If you play guitar, you must
know your chords. It is the same way with beer design. You must
know your ingredients, styles, and equipment. And you must
practice, practice, practice. Practice brewing other folk's
recipes. Practice brewing an old favorite but with different hops.
Practice with other methods of brewing. In practicing, you learn
the fundamentals of the art.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>We will choose a Pale Ale as an example for beer design. It is
assumed that you have studied the scientific method of beer design
first. You have to know the rules intimately before you are
qualified to break them. Thus, you should have a basic, bare-bones
pale ale recipe already ready.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Taste as many different beers that fit your intended style as is
practical. You can't design a masterpiece of a stout if the only
stout you've ever tasted has been Guinness. What makes the
different samples different from each other? What do they have in
common?</p>

<p>From these tastings, and from you experience as a brewer, what
do characteristics do you want your beer to have? Maltiness?
Bitterness? A hint of coffee? Are you able to provide your beer
with these qualities? If you want the clean, crisp bitterness of a
Bohemian Pilsener, but don't have the capability to lager, then you
should try something else.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>Go to your local brewpub and taste their pale ale. Take notes.
Go to the liquor store and pick up a few commercial examples. Taste
them. Take notes. For this example, we decide that we want the
following characteristics: sharp bitterness, woody aroma, caramel
notes, and a hint of red in the color.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As with the scientific method, start with the malt. This is the
canvas upon which you will paint. Do you use pale or pilsener
malts? Extra light malt extract or amber extract? From your
experience, you should know which malts grant which quality. Your
vision of what your beer will be might point you towards
complicated mashing schedules or towards simple extracts.</p>

<p>Malt extracts will tend to have thin body as compared to
all-grain recipes. Pale malts produce a "bigger" body than lager
malts. Infusion mashes will have less maltiness than decoction
mashes. Dark malts have a curious flavor-to-color continuum that
requires understanding through practice. Crystal and caramel malts
have yet a different flavor-to-color continuum.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>We will start with a canvas of light malt extract. This will
have a neutral base from which we can work. For the caramel notes
we definitely need crystal or caramel malt. Since the darker
crystal malts add reddish notes to the color, we will choose a
scottish crystal malt of 90L color. Our experience as brewers will
tell us how much to use. We will also add a tablespoon of chocolate
malt to add complexity.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Hops are the bold colors in our palette. High-alpha hops are
great for adding bitterness, but they are not always desirable. But
on the other hand, too much low-alpha hops used for bitterness can
lend a "spinachy" quality. Blends of hops can add wonderful
complexity to beers. Many hop additions at narrow time intervals
will extract more flavor and aroma than just a couple. Refer to
your tasting notes.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>Pale ales are noted for the bitterness, so we have to paint
broad strokes. We will start with galena hops for their high-alpha
content. For the woody notes, fuggles are ideal (and traditional).
We end up with galena additions at the start of the boil, fuggles
at twenty minutes, galena at fifteen minutes (to get some of its
noted flavor), fuggles at ten, fuggles at five, galena and fuggles
at two, and dry hopping with fuggles. Whew! The exact proportions
we determine through experience.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>There is no substitute for experience in choosing a yeast. You
may already have chosen a "house" yeast, one that you use for every
batch. Many award winning breweries do this. In painting, the
quality of the pigments is of great concern. So it is with all
brewing ingredients, but especially yeast. Check the time stamps on
your smack packs, or culture your own. Dry yeast are okay for
lesser beers, but for your masterpiece they won't do at all unless
they are absolutely fresh. Using more than one kind of yeast is
perfectly normal. Do it if your vision tells you to.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>We loved the character that the "Irish Dry Stout" gave to our
scientifically brewed stout, and decide to use it for the pale ale!
It gave us a woody, earthy character. This yeast will be our
drama.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For water, the scientific method can serve us well. But a good
rule of thumb is to use the water one already has, without
adjustments, just like a master painter uses his or her natural
talents. If the water is not perfectly suitable, one can either
take note of it and let it be, or adjust the recipe to compensate.
Perhaps a sauer mash or dark malts can be used to adjust pH. Or
perhaps blending one's hard water with quality bottled soft
water.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>Our water, in this example, is of medium hardness.
Traditionally, pale ales were brewed with hard water. Our artistic
sense tells us not to use prepackaged "Burton" salts. Of course, if
we had to work with soft water, we might have to. We decide to use
our water as is, with pride.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Other ingredients can be the hallmark of the artistic brewer.
But experience, not experimentation is needed. For fruit beers, the
finished fruit flavor will not always taste like the fresh fruit,
since many aromas will have been purged with the CO<sub>2</sub>
during fermentation. For your masterpiece, it goes without saying
that real fruit is preferable to bottled extracts. Honey can add a
lightness to the beer, but be aware that it will ferment
slowly.</p>

<table bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr>
<td>
<p>We will not use any other ingredients in our beer. However, if
it turns out superb, we might decide to use it as the basis for a
future fruit beer. An artistic brewer is always thinking about
future brews. Let's see, blackberry pale ale. Apricot pale ale.
Cranberry pale ale. Hey, that last one sounds interesting!</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If your finished beer is not a masterpiece, don't fret. Taste
and analyse the results to help determine what needs adjusting. A
bit more aroma hops? A bit less vienna malt? Pass it out to all
your friends and drink the rest up to give you room for your next
creation.</p>
