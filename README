QBrew, Version 0.4
==================

QBrew is a homebrewing recipe calculator for Unix, Macintosh and Windows. The
QBrew homepage is at <http://www.usermode.org/code.html>.

Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions. Additional
documentation can be found in the source tree under 'docs'.

Please see the AUTHORS file for a list of contributors, and the ChangeLog file
for a list of changes since the previous release.

QBrew is released under a very liberal license which reflects the author's
wishes with regards to this software. No payment or registration is required,
but the author would be extremely delighted to receive bottles filled with
homebrew created with QBrew. Photos of such bottles will do in a pinch. If you
wish to contribute to the further inebriation of the author, please send mail
to <david@usermode.org> requesting a physical address to send the bottles to.

Cash or code contributions are, of course, always welcome, and will grease the
wheels of QBrew development.
