qbrew for Debian
----------------

If you want to know how to start brewing yourself, there's a manual for that
available from within the program - Menu "Help", Topic "Primer".

QBrew comes with two sample recipes in the package directory,
"/usr/share/doc/qbrew/examples". Although they look sane, I haven't tried
them myself and cannot guarantee for the taste ;-)

Happy brewing!
