  * Fix Lintian warnings:

qbrew (0.3.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove libglib2.0-dev from Build-Depends again, the dependancy has
    now been added to the libqt4-dev package.
  * qmake seems to have problems in properly quoting constants given via
    the -D switch on the command line since version 4.2. The last upload
    already has a workaround for this, but in order to not FTBFS with
    previous Qt versions, the Build-Depends on libqt4-dev is now
    versioned.

 -- Tobias Toedter <t.toedter@gmx.net>  Sun, 22 Oct 2006 18:49:16 +0200

qbrew (0.3.9-3) unstable; urgency=medium

    script to make gcc happy

 -- Tobias Toedter <t.toedter@gmx.net>  Tue,  5 Sep 2006 16:10:21 +0200

qbrew (0.3.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Code has been rewritten to work with Qt 4
    - The Database Tool uses a new Qt view class, the segfault which
      existed in the Qt 3 version is no longer present. Closes: #343910
  * patches/ directory
    - All former code changes are integrated or obsolete after the
      upstream rewrite
    - The library linking is done much smarter now, so that the stripping
      of unneeded libraries (introduced in the previous upload) is no
      longer necessary.
    - New patch to drop a build dependency on libqt4-debug-dev
    - New patch to install the handbook and primer HTML files in a
      proper location
    - New patch to fix a typo in the copyright dialog box
  * Build-Depends on quilt to manage the patches
  * Remove Build-Depends on autotools-dev. The build system uses qmake,
    which does not need config.sub and config.guess.
  * Add new file "install" which is used to copy the qbrew handbook and
    brewing primer to the appropriate locations
  * Register the brewing primer with doc-base
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.7.2, no changes needed

 -- Tobias Toedter <t.toedter@gmx.net>  Sat, 19 Aug 2006 12:43:17 +0200

qbrew (0.3.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new patch to fix a FTBFS error with GCC 4.1.
    Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for the report and patch. Closes: #357467
  * Rewrote upstream's checks for needed libraries to cut down the number
    of unnecessary linked in libraries. In effect, qbrew does no longer
    depend on libx11-dev, libice-dev, libsm-dev, and libxext-dev.
  * Build-Depends-Indep: debhelper >= 5.0.0
  * Bumped compat file from version 4 to 5
  * Updated copyright file with current year
  * Corrected formatting of the Homepage: entry in the description

 -- Tobias Toedter <t.toedter@gmx.net>  Sat, 22 Apr 2006 16:30:32 +0200

qbrew (0.3.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Extracted the pixmaps from the patch into files in the debian
    directory, so they can be deleted in the clean target
  * Instead of removing the upstream config.sub and config.guess,
    they are now backed up and restored in the clean target
  * Properly escaped a dash in the manpage
  * Added a new target to debian/rules for regenerating the xpm images
    for the menu manager (generate-xpm). It requires sodipodi and mogrify
    and uses the SVG file provided by upstream
  * New patch (20_controller-warning.diff) which fixes a compiler
    warning in the files controller.cpp and controller.h
  * The script configure gets run now without using env for passing
    parameters; instead, the simpler form NAME=VALUE is used
  * Warnings about a missing non-virtual destructor in the Qt functions
    are suppressed currently, those will be fixed with the new release
    of Qt 4.0

  * Replaced the build dependency on xlibs-dev with libx11-dev, libsm-dev,
    libice-dev, and libxext-dev
  * Dropped the build dependency on dpatch, the patches are now applied
    with a hand-made system
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.6.2, no changes needed

 -- Tobias Toedter <t.toedter@gmx.net>  Thu, 22 Sep 2005 22:57:08 +0200

qbrew (0.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Included the file AUTHORS

  * Changing the copyright file to say something meaningful about
    the copyright

  * Removed zlib1g and xutils from Build-Depends, since they both were
    not needed at all. Oops.

    special actions to perform. The necessary scripts are now generated
    automatically by dh_installdocs and dh_installmenu
  * Quoted all strings in the menu file

 -- Tobias Toedter <t.toedter@gmx.net>  Sun,  7 Mar 2004 16:43:23 +0100
