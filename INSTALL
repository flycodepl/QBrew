QBrew Installation
===================

These instructions are for building and installing QBrew from source
code. QBrew requires the Qt 4.3 or greater development libraries. These
can be found at <http://www.trolltech.com>. Some Linux distributions
separate Qt into separate runtime and development packages. If this
is your case, Make sure you have both. QBrew uses the qmake tool to
generate makefiles, and thus depends on a properly configured Qt
installation.

Note that I am not providing installation support for QBrew, and will
consider such a submission to be a bug report as opposed to a support
request. I can be contacted at <david@usermode.org>.

Sincerely,
David Johnson

Unix Build
==========

0) Make sure the prerequisite Qt library is installed.

1) Unarchive the source code package, and change into its directory.

2) Type './configure --help", and peruse the configure options available.
   It may be necessary to use one or more of these options on your system.

3) Type './configure' to configure the package for your system. If you're
   using `csh', you might need to type `sh ./configure' instead.

4) Type 'make' to compile the package.

5) Login, su or sudo to root. This is not necessary if you
   configured the package to install to your home directory.

6) Type 'make install' to install the program and documentation.

7) Type `qbrew' to run the program.

Mac OSX Build
=============

0) Make sure the prerequisite Qt library is installed.

1) Unarchive the source code package, and change into its directory.

2) Set Qt related environment variables (assumes bash shell):
       QTDIR=/Developer/qt (or as appropriate)
       QMAKESPEC=macx-g++
       PATH=$PATH:$QTDIR/bin
       export QTDIR QMAKESPEC PATH

3) Build the package:
       qmake -o Makefile qbrew.pro
       make

4) Populate the application bundle
        make install

5) You may wish to include the Qt runtime with the application bundle. Please
   see the "Deploying on Application on Qt/Mac" article for more information.
   A deployment script is included in the mac directory, that may be useful.

6) Now move the application bundle to your desired location
        mv qbrew.app ~/Desktop

Windows Build
=============

0) Make sure the prerequisite Qt library is installed.

1) Unarchive the source code package, and change into its directory.

2) Build the package:
       qmake qbrew.pro
       make (or nmake)

4) Place into a final installation directory, with the following minimum
   structure:
       qbrew.exe
       splash.png
       datafile
       doc\html\* (all html help files)
       translations\* (all qm files)

5) You may also wish to include the Qt DLL and other runtime libraries in the
   installation directory.
